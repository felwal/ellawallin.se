Hi, I’m Ella Wallin, a Swedish concept artist with a love for nature. I specialize in environments, and I love creating spaces that feel alive, emotional and a little bit magical.

I recently graduated from the Animation Concept Art program at Vancouver Film School and I am currently available for freelance, internships or junior roles. I’m especially drawn to warm light, expressive colors, and scenes that spark a sense of wonder or nostalgia.

When I’m not painting, you’ll probably find me wandering around exploring the great outdoors, dancing to my favorite songs, or getting lost in fantasy books.

Thanks for stopping by!
